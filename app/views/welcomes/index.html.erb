        <p>Went to the 'Travel in your own city' Workshop today and not only got to learn how to make a super cool candle out of soy wax and essential oils, but also got to meet so many nice and inspiring women. It was a great experience and I can't wait for the next one!!</p>

        <p>It was my first time to visit both France & Spain. Afraid? Not at all!!! Hana, as our organizer, took care of every detail from the very beginning to the very ending. Hanging out with them was also great, everyone could speak French but they all spoke English just for me:) Laura, one of the team members, even played the translator role in Spain.
        <br>I was trying to achieve the value of each trip as much as I can, but had no ideas how to do this every time. Travelogue told me the answer: learn something new in each travel! Surfing was such a wonderful match with Basque area and the skill will always stay with me even after long time.</p>

        <p>I finally got to learn to beautiful art of Macram√© thanks to @Travelogue and the wonderful @Hana and @Bohazel!
        <br>Yesterday's workshop at Bohazel was great, small groups and chill and friendly vibe with sangria. We even got to go home with our self-made plant hanger but also a beautiful plant!
        <br>I'm a workshopoholic, I'll definitely try out other workshops from Travelogue! </p>
