    %h1 Surf Retreat to Basque Country
    %h2 September 20-25, 2017 | ~ â‚¬600
    %p You've got six days to travel with six other women. Some may be strangers but after a few days, you'll become a traveling tribe.
    %p You'll land in Bordeaux where you'll explore the city as a local, practice your French, dive into the food culture and do your best to get a little lost.
    %p From there, you'll head to Hendaye near the border of Spain. Hendaye is a surfer paradise in the Southwest of France that has a little Spanish flavor.
    %p Over the next few days you'll learn how to surf from a man named Laurent, relax on the beach and practice your yoga moves.
    %p When you've finally triumphed hopping onto a surfboard, you'll venture to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, the darling of Basques country! Here the positivity from learning something new will continue to flow like the French wine you'll surely be sipping on.
    %p As all great things end, you'll head back to Bordeaux or wherever you are off to next wrapping up a memorable trip with memorable women.
    %p Please email for a fixed price based upon room choice.
